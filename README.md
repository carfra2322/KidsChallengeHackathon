# KidsChallengeHackathon
Amazon Alexa Skills challenge: Kids 
We created a story telling interactive app, where we tell a couple of different stories, more can be addded. 

We used:
-Zappa for deployment in AWS
-Flask-ask (python), we have historia.py as the backend source code using templates.yaml for speech responses including SSML.
-ngrok for local testing
The story has 2 alternatives roads as it stands right now, we could later add if needed. Kids can interact with the stories in some ways such as choosing which utensil the old man chose (spoon or butter knife).  We also used sound effects to make the story more engaging.
